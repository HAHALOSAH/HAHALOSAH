My name is HAHALOSAH, and I love to code and play games! I play Minecraft and make plugins (Spigot).

I also make tweaks for jailbroken devices. I have an iPhone 11 running iOS 14.3, and I made the [NoFreeAppLimit](https://repo.hhls.tk/tweaks/NoFreeAppLimit/) tweak that removes the 3 app limit for free developer accounts (iOS).

Need anything? Feel free to PM me on Discord. My tag is HAHALOSAH#2191 and my DMs are open.
